### About Me

I put my coding projects here, although yes I do code HTML sites from scratch or templates, but since I mostly do web design rather than code a website, therefore many of my site repositories are designed and built with [Brizy Cloud](https://brizy.io/cloud), it's much easier that way.

Though I make websites, I also have certain Discord bots, mostly hosted on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud), they offer always free plan which allows you to create a limited amount of VMs for your own sake of use!
